# PYTHON MODULE

### About this analysis-

1. I've had office hours with all three TAs this week. Making sure I have everything set up and I can find my path and relative paths for the CSV files (It was extremely useful to use relative paths in this assignment). I still need to do a more 1on1 session outside those hours.
2. My group has had more time sharing resources together in class when we find them.
3. I will say one thing this time that I need to learn more about exporting files. I had to look that up with AI. Most of the exporting to txt and formatting into it I didn't know since we didn't cover it in class.
4. A big stumbling block I had was trying to start counts in the second row, which was frustrating. I even named it 'donotcount' in line 19 on PyBank and 'skipheader' on PyPoll in line 18. I kept forgetting this step. (Later on today I found that the cereal solution code had the solution in the stackoverflow link. I had already however, looked it up online. This helped me look at the same approach being used in two different scenarios).
5. Something I have to say was helpful to do in-between what I did know and what I didn't... was RUN THE CODE. A lot. This helped me to know that I at least had the logic behind the loop correct when I didn't know how to export to the txt so I tested and tried to do a 'print(winner)' at that stage and I knew I wasn't too far off.
6. I need to learn a lot about formatting and dictionaries(I noticed in PyBank) though. I've realized that I can improve here.
7. A specific code that I can say was almost unchanged for both parts of this, was last week's code sample showing us how to print from a txt file. I was looking through the class code and I found it so useful that I copy-pasted it almost exactly as it was.
